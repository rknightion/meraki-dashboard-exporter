=== ROUND 4: SNMP-EXCLUSIVE METRICS ===

After analyzing SNMP MIBs (MERAKI-CLOUD-CONTROLLER-MIB and device-specific OIDs), here are metrics available via SNMP that provide unique value beyond the Dashboard API:

NOTE: Cloud Controller SNMP is primarily valuable for:
- SNMP trap reception (device up/down, security events)
- Basic monitoring when direct device SNMP is not possible
- Organization-wide device inventory via SNMP

=== SNMP COLLECTION CONSIDERATIONS ===

1. **Polling Frequency**:
   - Error counters: 60 seconds (FAST) - DEVICE SNMP
   - Memory/CPU: 60 seconds (FAST) - DEVICE SNMP
   - MAC table size: 300 seconds (MEDIUM) - DEVICE SNMP
   - Hardware sensors: 900 seconds (SLOW) - DEVICE SNMP
   - Cloud status: 300 seconds (MEDIUM) - CLOUD SNMP

2. **SNMP Version**:
   - Prefer SNMPv3 for security
   - Fall back to SNMPv2c if required
   - Bulk operations for efficiency

3. **Access Methods**:
   - Cloud Controller SNMP: Organization-wide basic metrics and traps
   - Direct Device SNMP: Granular performance and error counters
   - Requires SNMP community/credentials configuration

4. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Start with Cloud Controller SNMP for basic coverage
   - Add Device SNMP for critical devices needing detailed monitoring
   - Use Cloud SNMP traps for real-time alerting
   - Device SNMP for troubleshooting and capacity planning

5. **Unique Value Propositions**:
   - Real-time error detection (Device SNMP)
   - Memory leak identification (Device SNMP)
   - Hardware failure prediction (Device SNMP)
   - Layer 2 loop detection (Device SNMP)
   - RF interference troubleshooting (Device SNMP)
   - SNMP trap-based alerting (Cloud SNMP)

=== SNMP-EXCLUSIVE INSIGHTS ===

These SNMP metrics provide:
- **Faster Detection**: 5-second CPU spikes, immediate error counts
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Specific error types (CRC vs alignment vs symbol)
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Fan RPM degradation, temperature trends
- **Hidden Problems**: MAC flapping, multicast floods, buffer exhaustion
- **Compliance**: Detailed PoE power measurements for safety audits

=== IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR NEW METRICS ===

**Performance Metrics (P1.1-P1.5)**
- Critical for monitoring refactor effectiveness
- Track before/after refactor to measure improvements
- Use for alerting on performance degradation

**Caching Metrics (P1.4)**
- Essential for tuning cache TTLs
- Monitor hit ratios to optimize cache strategy
- Alert on low hit ratios (<50%)

**Metric Lifecycle (P1.3)**
- Prevent cardinality explosion
- Monitor stale metric cleanup
- Alert on unbounded growth

**Resource Metrics**
- Critical for capacity planning
- Monitor memory growth trends
- Alert on high memory usage (>80% of limit)

**Collection Tiering**
- Detect stuck collectors
- Monitor for skipped collections
- Ensure tiers complete within intervals
