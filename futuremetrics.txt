=== SNMP COLLECTION CONSIDERATIONS ===

1. **Polling Frequency**:
   - Error counters: 60 seconds (FAST) - DEVICE SNMP
   - Memory/CPU: 60 seconds (FAST) - DEVICE SNMP
   - MAC table size: 300 seconds (MEDIUM) - DEVICE SNMP
   - Hardware sensors: 900 seconds (SLOW) - DEVICE SNMP
   - Cloud status: 300 seconds (MEDIUM) - CLOUD SNMP

2. **SNMP Version**:
   - Prefer SNMPv3 for security
   - Fall back to SNMPv2c if required
   - Bulk operations for efficiency

3. **Access Methods**:
   - Cloud Controller SNMP: Organization-wide basic metrics and traps
   - Direct Device SNMP: Granular performance and error counters
   - Requires SNMP community/credentials configuration

4. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Start with Cloud Controller SNMP for basic coverage
   - Add Device SNMP for critical devices needing detailed monitoring
   - Use Cloud SNMP traps for real-time alerting
   - Device SNMP for troubleshooting and capacity planning

5. **Unique Value Propositions**:
   - Real-time error detection (Device SNMP)
   - Memory leak identification (Device SNMP)
   - Hardware failure prediction (Device SNMP)
