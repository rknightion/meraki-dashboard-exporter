# Meraki Dashboard Exporter - Refactoring Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of refactoring opportunities for the Meraki Dashboard Exporter project to improve LLM maintainability and align with modern Python best practices.
## Aims of refactor

Easier for LLM consumption
1. **Smaller, focused files**: Easier for LLMs to understand and modify specific functionality
2. **Clear patterns**: Consistent code patterns make it easier for LLMs to replicate and extend
3. **Strong typing**: Type annotations provide clear contracts and prevent errors
4. **Self-documenting code**: Domain models and clear naming reduce need for external context
5. **Modular architecture**: Easy to add new features without understanding entire codebase
6. **Consistent error handling**: Predictable behavior makes debugging easier
7. **Clear separation of concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility

After each sub task is completed YOU MUST update this document to move the task from Pending or In progress to completed tasks at the bottom of this document. This is so we can split the refactor across multiple sessions.

When refactoring ensure any failing tests are updated to support the post refactored code.
Ensure claude.md file is updated where necessary for better LLM concept (only update it if it is useful or in line with claude.md best practices)

  - Sub-collectors: mr.py (19 metrics), ms.py (8 metrics)
  - All metrics now use enum values for type safety
- Migrated ALL collectors to use LabelName enum instead of hardcoded label strings:
  - Added missing labels to enum: sensor_type, mode, duplex, standard, radio_index
  - Updated all labelnames arrays in all collectors
  - Example: ["serial", "name"] → [LabelName.SERIAL, LabelName.NAME]
- Created example refactored collectors demonstrating new patterns
- Metrics documentation generator updated and verified (76 metrics documented)
**Benefit**: Complete type safety for metric names and labels, zero hardcoded strings, reduced chance of typos, consistent patterns across entire codebase, easier for LLMs to understand and extend.

### Additional Refactoring: Metric Organization and Ownership - COMPLETED
**Issue**: Metric initialization was scattered across files, with device-specific metrics defined in device.py rather than their respective sub-collectors.
**Refactor Completed**:
- Phase 1: Moved all 33 MR-specific metrics to MRCollector._initialize_metrics()
- Phase 2: Moved all 8 MS-specific metrics to MSCollector._initialize_metrics()
- Phase 3: Verified other collectors (MX, MG, MV) don't need changes as they have no device-specific metrics
- Phase 4: Created generate_metrics_docs.py tool that:
  - Uses AST parsing to find all metric definitions
  - Resolves MetricName constants to actual values
  - Generates comprehensive METRICS.md documentation
  - Documents all 61 metrics with their types, labels, and descriptions
- Reduced device.py from 782 to 730 lines
- Added abstract collect() method to BaseDeviceCollector for type safety
**Benefit**: Device-specific metrics are now owned by their respective collectors, making it much easier for LLMs to understand which metrics belong to which device type. The metric documentation generator provides comprehensive metric reference.

### 1.1 Split device.py (1,894 lines) - COMPLETED
**Issue**: The device.py collector was extremely large and handled multiple device types in a single file.
**Refactor Completed**:
- Enhanced BaseDeviceCollector with common functionality including memory metrics collection
- Created MXCollector for MX security appliances
- Created MGCollector for MG cellular gateways
- Created MVCollector for MV security cameras
- Updated DeviceCollector to use a device type mapping dictionary for dynamic dispatch
- Added generic _collect_device_with_timeout method that routes to appropriate collectors
- Updated all imports and fixed type issues
- All tests pass successfully
**Benefit**: Device types are now modular, making it easier for LLMs to understand and modify specific device type logic without affecting others. The main DeviceCollector is now primarily a coordinator rather than containing all device-specific logic.

### 1.2 Split network_health.py (731 lines) - COMPLETED
**Issue**: Single file handled multiple network health aspects (RF health, connection stats, data rates, bluetooth clients).
**Refactor Completed**:
- Created BaseNetworkHealthCollector with common functionality
- Created RFHealthCollector for channel utilization metrics
- Created ConnectionStatsCollector for wireless connection statistics
- Created DataRatesCollector for network throughput metrics

- Updated OrganizationCollector to coordinate sub-collectors
- Removed helper methods that were moved to sub-collectors
- Reduced file size from 762 to 396 lines (48% reduction)
**Benefit**: Clearer separation of concerns, easier to modify specific organization metric types without understanding the entire organization collector.

### Additional Refactoring: MT Sensor Collection - COMPLETED
**Issue**: sensor.py was handling MT device sensor collection separately from the MT device collector, creating unnecessary separation.
**Refactor Completed**:
- Moved all sensor collection logic to MTCollector with a collect_sensor_metrics method
- Created MTSensorCollector as a dedicated FAST tier collector that uses MTCollector internally
- Removed sensor.py completely to avoid confusion
- MTCollector now handles both device-level metrics (through DeviceCollector) and sensor-specific metrics
- Updated manager.py to use MTSensorCollector directly
**Benefit**: Single source of truth for MT device logic, clearer architecture, reduced code duplication.

### Additional Refactoring: device.py Cleanup - COMPLETED
**Issue**: device.py was still 1,968 lines after initial refactoring, containing many device-specific methods that belonged in sub-collectors.
**Refactor Completed**:
- Moved all MR-specific methods to MRCollector (822 lines removed):
  - _collect_wireless_clients → MRCollector.collect_wireless_clients
  - _collect_mr_ethernet_status → MRCollector.collect_ethernet_status
  - _collect_mr_packet_loss → MRCollector.collect_packet_loss
  - _collect_mr_cpu_load → MRCollector.collect_cpu_load

  - `api_constants.py`: APIField, APITimespan, LicenseState, PortState, RFBand, default values
  - `sensor_constants.py`: SensorMetricType, SensorDataField for sensor-specific constants
  - `metrics_constants.py`: Domain-specific metric name enums (OrgMetricName, NetworkMetricName, etc.)
  - `config_constants.py`: APIConfig and MerakiAPIConfig dataclasses for configuration
- Added Literal type aliases for small closed sets (e.g., DeviceTypeStr, DeviceStatusStr)
- Replaced magic strings throughout codebase:
  - Device type/model checks now use DeviceType enum
  - Product types use ProductType enum
  - Device status uses DeviceStatus enum with DEFAULT_DEVICE_STATUS
  - Sensor metric types and fields use respective enums
- Removed all backward compatibility code:
  - All collectors now import and use domain-specific metric enums directly
  - Removed the old constants.py re-export file
  - Each collector uses the appropriate domain enum (e.g., OrgMetricName for organization metrics)
**Benefit**: Better organization, type safety, easier to find relevant constants, reduced typos, clearer domain separation for LLMs, no extra backward compatibility code to maintain.

### 4.1 Simplify Collector Registration - COMPLETED
**Issue**: Manual collector registration in manager required updating multiple places for new collectors.
**Refactor Completed**:
- Created `core/registry.py` with global collector registry:
  - `@register_collector(tier)` decorator for auto-registration
  - Registry tracks collectors by update tier
  - Helper functions: `get_registered_collectors()`, `clear_registry()`
- Updated CollectorManager to use registry instead of hardcoding:
  - `_initialize_collectors()` now imports all collector modules (triggers registration)
  - Iterates through registry to create collector instances
  - Added error handling for failed collector initialization
- Applied decorator to all main collectors:
  - AlertsCollector, ConfigCollector, DeviceCollector
  - MTSensorCollector, NetworkHealthCollector, OrganizationCollector
- Added comprehensive tests:
  - Unit tests for registry functionality
  - Integration tests for CollectorManager with registry
- Updated CLAUDE.md with decorator usage guidance
**Benefit**: No manual registration needed, self-documenting code, impossible to forget registering a collector, cleaner separation of concerns, easier for LLMs to add new collectors.

- Updated hardcoded values to use configuration:
  - API concurrency limit in AsyncMerakiClient
  - Batch size defaults in APIHelper
  - Batch delay in device collector
- Created configuration documentation generator tool
- Updated CLAUDE.md with configuration management section
**Benefit**: Clearer configuration structure with validation, profile-based deployment scenarios, backward compatibility maintained, easier for LLMs to understand nested configuration with proper typing.

### 4.3 Standardize Async Patterns - COMPLETED

- **Decision**: Keep utilities for complex scenarios but don't migrate all API calls
- **Rationale**: Meraki SDK already provides retry (3x), rate limit handling, and timeout support
- Async utilities complement SDK for complex coordination, not replace it
**Benefit**: Available for complex async coordination without duplicating SDK functionality, prevents double-retry issues, clearer when to use SDK defaults vs custom patterns.

### 5.3 Standardize Logging Patterns - COMPLETED
