# Meraki Dashboard Exporter - Refactoring Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of refactoring opportunities for the Meraki Dashboard Exporter project to improve LLM maintainability and align with modern Python best practices.
## Aims of refactor

Easier for LLM consumption
1. **Smaller, focused files**: Easier for LLMs to understand and modify specific functionality
2. **Clear patterns**: Consistent code patterns make it easier for LLMs to replicate and extend
3. **Strong typing**: Type annotations provide clear contracts and prevent errors
4. **Self-documenting code**: Domain models and clear naming reduce need for external context
5. **Modular architecture**: Easy to add new features without understanding entire codebase
6. **Consistent error handling**: Predictable behavior makes debugging easier
7. **Clear separation of concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility

After each sub task is completed YOU MUST update this document to move the task from Pending or In progress to completed tasks at the bottom of this document. This is so we can split the refactor across multiple sessions.

When refactoring ensure any failing tests are updated to support the post refactored code.
Ensure claude.md file is updated where necessary for better LLM concept (only update it if it is useful or in line with claude.md best practices)

- Created ClientOverviewCollector for client count and usage metrics
- Updated OrganizationCollector to coordinate sub-collectors
- Removed helper methods that were moved to sub-collectors
- Reduced file size from 762 to 396 lines (48% reduction)
**Benefit**: Clearer separation of concerns, easier to modify specific organization metric types without understanding the entire organization collector.

### Additional Refactoring: MT Sensor Collection - COMPLETED
**Issue**: sensor.py was handling MT device sensor collection separately from the MT device collector, creating unnecessary separation.
**Refactor Completed**:
- Moved all sensor collection logic to MTCollector with a collect_sensor_metrics method
- Created MTSensorCollector as a dedicated FAST tier collector that uses MTCollector internally
- Removed sensor.py completely to avoid confusion
- MTCollector now handles both device-level metrics (through DeviceCollector) and sensor-specific metrics
- Updated manager.py to use MTSensorCollector directly
**Benefit**: Single source of truth for MT device logic, clearer architecture, reduced code duplication.

### Additional Refactoring: device.py Cleanup - COMPLETED
**Issue**: device.py was still 1,968 lines after initial refactoring, containing many device-specific methods that belonged in sub-collectors.
**Refactor Completed**:
- Moved all MR-specific methods to MRCollector (822 lines removed):
  - _collect_wireless_clients → MRCollector.collect_wireless_clients
  - _collect_mr_ethernet_status → MRCollector.collect_ethernet_status
  - _collect_mr_packet_loss → MRCollector.collect_packet_loss
  - _collect_mr_cpu_load → MRCollector.collect_cpu_load
