## 🤖 LLM Agent Instructions for Working with This Document

### On Session Start
1. **Always read this file first** to understand current project state
2. **Check "Current Migration Tasks"** section to identify active work
3. **Review most recent `[>] IN PROGRESS` items** to understand what was being worked on
4. **Read blockers marked `[!]`** to avoid redundant attempts at blocked tasks

### During Active Work
1. **Mark tasks `[>]` when starting work** — update status immediately when beginning a task
2. **Keep exactly ONE task `[>]` at a time** (unless parallelizable work)
3. **Update task status in real-time** — don't batch status updates
4. **Add inline notes** after task descriptions when encountering:
   - Implementation decisions made
   - Blockers or issues discovered
   - File paths or modules created/modified
   - API changes or breaking changes
   Example: `- [x] P6.5.2: Build device table — NOTE: Used QTableView with proxy model for filtering; main widget in ui/devices/widgets.py:DeviceTableWidget`
5. **Complete as many sub/child tasks along with the parent at the same time as reasonable especially if they are related

### Task Completion
1. **Mark `[x]` ONLY when fully complete** — if partial, leave as `[>]` with status note
2. **Do NOT mark complete if**:
   - Tests are failing
   - Implementation is partial
   - Errors remain unresolved
   - Dependencies are missing
3. **Move completed task details** to appropriate "What Has Been Completed" phase section for context preservation

### Discovering New Work
0. **Proceed with the order of parent tasks as listed in this document. The numbering may not be sequential it is the order of the parent task that's important in this document**
1. **Add new subtasks freely** when you discover additional work needed
2. **Use hierarchical numbering** (e.g., P6.5.1, P6.5.2, P6.5.2.1) to nest related tasks
3. **Place new tasks in appropriate phase** or create new phase if scope expands
4. **Flag architectural decisions** that may impact other phases
5. **Note if task should be deferred** to later phase with reasoning

### On Session End (CRITICAL)
1. **Update all `[>]` items** with current status or notes
2. **Document any blockers** encountered with `[!]` and explanation
3. **List files modified** in session summary area (if not already in task notes)
4. **Add "What's Ready" notes** if you've completed infrastructure others can build on
5. **Recommend next steps** to help future sessions pick up momentum

### Context7 MCP Usage (CRITICAL)
When working with Cisco Meraki Dashboard API:
- **Always check Meraki API docs** via Context7 MCP before implementing Meraki API calls
- Use library ID `openapi/api_meraki_api_v1_openapispec` for the latest Meraki API Spec. You can search for calls or functionality you want and it will return usage snippets.
- Use library ID `meraki/dashboard-api-python` for context on the Meraki Python SDK we use for API calls

### Task Expansion Philosophy
- **Do expand tasks** when you discover complexity not originally captured
- **Do add tasks** for quality/testing/documentation as you work
- **Do adjust future phases** if project architecture evolves
- **Don't be constrained** by original task list — this is a living document
- **Do preserve intent** of original phases while adapting tactical approach


# Meraki Dashboard Exporter - Refactoring Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of refactoring opportunities for the Meraki Dashboard Exporter project to improve LLM maintainability and align with modern Python best practices.
## Aims of refactor

Easier for LLM consumption
1. **Smaller, focused files**: Easier for LLMs to understand and modify specific functionality
2. **Clear patterns**: Consistent code patterns make it easier for LLMs to replicate and extend
3. **Strong typing**: Type annotations provide clear contracts and prevent errors
4. **Self-documenting code**: Domain models and clear naming reduce need for external context
5. **Modular architecture**: Easy to add new features without understanding entire codebase
6. **Consistent error handling**: Predictable behavior makes debugging easier
7. **Clear separation of concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility

Improve exporter/collector performance

After each sub task is completed YOU MUST update this document to move the task from Pending or In progress to completed tasks at the bottom of this document. This is so we can split the refactor across multiple sessions.

When refactoring ensure any failing tests are updated to support the post refactored code.
Ensure claude.md file is updated where necessary for better LLM concept (only update it if it is useful or in line with claude.md best practices)


This file also serves as the ongoing todo tracking document.

## Legend
- [ ] TODO — not started
- [>] IN PROGRESS — actively being worked
- [x] DONE — complete
- [!] BLOCKED — pending external input
